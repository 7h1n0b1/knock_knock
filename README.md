Let computer do the redundant copy paste.

===========

So my room mate bought an alienware and now we are 3 people that wanted to play games on it.  
We divided our times but the problem was the game did not had multiple profiles in it. So everytime in order to play the game one needed to replace the saved games inside the C:\User\Name\Documents\Game folder with our previous saved games folder. So I thought why not computer do the work.
This script is written in VB (I thought it would be best to write in VB as it do not require any compilation and all...)
